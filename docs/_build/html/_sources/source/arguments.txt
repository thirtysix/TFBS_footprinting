### 4.4 Arguments
-  -h, --help show this help message and exit
-  --t_ids_file, -t  Required for running an analysis. Location of a file containing Ensembl target_species transcript ids. Input options are either a text file of Ensembl transcript ids or a .csv file with individual values set for each parameter.
-  --tf_ids_file, -tfs  Optional: Location of a file containing a limited list of Jaspar TFs to use in scoring alignment (see sample file tf_ids.txt at https://github.com/thirtysix/TFBS_footprinting)
    [default: all Jaspar TFs]
-  --target_species, -s 
    [default: "homo_sapiens"] - Target species (string), options are located at https://github.com/thirtysix/TFBS_footprinting/blob/master/README.md#6-species. Conservation of TFs across other species will be based on identifying them in this species first.
-  --species_group, -g 
    ("mammals", "primates", "sauropsids", or "fish")
    [default: "mammals"] - Group of species (string) to identify conservation of TFs within. Your target species should be a member of this species group (e.g.
    "homo_sapiens" and "mammals" or "primates"). The
    "primates" group does not have a low-coverage version. Groups and members are listed at https://github.com/thirtysix/TFBS_footprinting/blob/master/README.md#6-species.
-  --coverage, -e  ("low" or "high") [default: "low"] - Which Ensembl EPO alignment of species to use. The low coverage contains significantly more species and is recommended. The primate group does not have a low-coverage version.
-  --promoter_before_tss, -pb 
    (0-100,000) [default: 900] - Number (integer) of nucleotides upstream of TSS to include in analysis
    (0-100,000).
-  --promoter_after_tss, -pa 
    (0-100,000) [default: 100] - Number (integer) of nucleotides downstream of TSS to include in analysis.
-  --top_x_tfs, -tx(1-20) [default: 10] - Number (integer) of unique TFs to include in output .svg figure.
-  --pval PVAL, -p PVAL  P-value (float) for determine score cutoff (range: 0.1 to 0.0000001) [default: 0.01]
-  --exp_data_update, -update Download the latest experimental data files for use in analysis. Will run automatically if the "data" directory does not already exist (e.g. first usage).
