Predict TFBSs in the promoters any of 1-80,000 human protein coding transcripts in the Ensembl database.  TFBS predictions can also be made for 87 unique non-human species (including model organisms such as mouse and zebrafish), present in the following groups:

- 70 Eutherian mammals
- 24 Primates
- 11 Fish
- 7 Sauropsids

The TFBS footprinting method computationally predicts transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in a target species (e.g. homo sapiens) using 575 position weight matrices (PWMs) based on binding data from the JASPAR database.  Additional experimental data from a variety of sources is used to support or detract from these predictions:

* DNA sequence conservation in homologous mammal species sequences
* proximity to CAGE-supported transcription start sites (TSSs)
* correlation of expression between target gene and predicted transcription factor (TF) across 1800+ samples
* proximity to ChIP-Seq determined TFBSs (GTRD project)
* proximity to qualitative trait loci (eQTLs) affecting expression of the target gene (GTEX project)
* proximity to CpGs
* proximity to ATAC-Seq peaks (ENCODE project)
